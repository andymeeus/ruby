# YAML Ain't Markup Language
#
# This module provides a Ruby interface for data serialization in YAML format.
#
# The underlying implementation depends on an engine to handle the parsing and
# serialization for Ruby, by default this will be using the libyaml wrapper
# Psych.
#
# See Psych::EngineManager for details on switching the default YAML engine.
#
# Working with YAML can be very simple, for example:
#
#     require 'yaml' # STEP ONE, REQUIRE YAML!
#     # Parse a YAML string
#     YAML.load("--- foo") #=> "foo"
#
#     # Emit some YAML
#     YAML.dump("foo")     # => "--- foo\n...\n"
#     { :a => 'b'}.to_yaml  # => "---\n:a: b\n"
#
# Do not use YAML to load untrusted data. Doing so is unsafe and could allow
# malicious input to execute arbitrary code inside your application. Please see
# doc/security.rdoc for more information.
#
# For more advanced details on the implementation see Psych, and also check out
# yaml.org for spec details and other helpful information.
